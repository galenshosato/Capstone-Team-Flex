## The Problem

Gig workers, whether they are freelance writers, ride-share drivers, or musicians, face unpredictable income streams. Unlike salaried employees with fixed monthly paychecks, gig workers often struggle to predict their earnings, making it difficult to budget effectively. Traditional budgeting apps are designed for stable incomes and fixed expenses, offering little support for those operating in the gig economy. This leaves gig workers vulnerable to financial instability, unable to adequately plan for expenses, savings, or emergencies.

## Our Solution

We propose the development of a flexible budgeting app, FLEX, specifically designed for gig workers. This app will revolutionize the way gig workers manage their finances, providing real-time insights and adaptive budgeting tools to navigate the uncertainty of the gig economy.

### User Scenarios

-   Naomi works as a server and makes cash each night. She is trying to save up for a trip to Spain to see her brother. She wants to make sure that 10% of her income is going to a savings account. Naomi can use FLEX to assign a savings goal, and have a handy tracker to know how much to put away for savings

-   Anne is an uber driver who is also very budget conscious. She needs to be able to budget everything to the tee. She uses FLEX to make sure that she is spending 20% of her income on groceries, 20% on her rent/utilities, 10% for savings, and then 50% for fun!
